# DINCAE-benthic-traits

Neural network to generate maps of benthic traits using [DINCAE](https://github.com/gher-uliege/DINCAE.jl)


🚧 🚧 **work-in progress** 🚧 🚧


DINCAE is intended to be used with a [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) with [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) support (NVIDIA GPU). The code can also run on a [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) but which will be quite slow.


## List of dependencies

* julia 1.9 or later
* all other dependencies are listed in [Project.toml](https://github.com/neccton-algo/DINCAE-benthic-traits/blob/main/Project.toml)
