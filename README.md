# DINCAE-benthic-traits

Neural network to generate maps of benthic traits using [DINCAE](https://github.com/gher-uliege/DINCAE.jl) (Data-Interpolating Convolutional Auto-Encoder).

🚧 🚧 **This is work in-progress** 🚧 🚧

DINCAE is intended to be used with a [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) with [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) support (NVIDIA GPU). The code can also run on a [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) but which will be quite slow.


## List of dependencies

* The [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) programming language version 1.9 or later
* All other dependencies are listed in [Project.toml](https://github.com/neccton-algo/DINCAE-benthic-traits/blob/main/Project.toml). They are installed automatically by the [julia package manager](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/) as described in the installation section.
